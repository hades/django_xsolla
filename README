Django XSolla (2pay.ru) integration
===================================

This is a Django application that implements XSolla Virtual Currency
Protocol[1].

To use it, add the application to the INSTALLED_APPS section of your
settings.py, and a URL to the views.payment view. This view implements the
"payment script" as per protocol specification.

For example, if you have the following line in your urls.py:

 url(r'^payment/$', 'django_xsolla.views.payment'),

Then you should use the following URL as your payment script in XSolla project
settings:

 http://yoursite.com/payment/

You also need to provide the XSolla secret key in a settings.py variable
DJANGO_XSOLLA_SECRET_KEY.

Note, that by default, django_xsolla verifies that the "v1" parameter is a valid
django.contrib.auth user id. If you do not want this, remove the corresponding
code from views.py.
